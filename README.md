# Using-Python-for-Research
HarvardX's PH526X

This repository contains code used in the Using Python for Research course on HarvardX. This course seeks to bridge introductory Python courses with the use of Python in scientific computing by introducing modules like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn and using them in case studies. The course is broken up across five weeks, with ten homework assignments and a final project. The topics are as follows:

1. Week 1: Basics of Python 3
2. Week 2: Python Libraries and Concepts Used in Research
3. Week 3: Case Studies Part 1: DNA Translation, Language Processing, and Classification
4. Week 4: Case Studies Part 2: Whisky Classification, Bird Migration, and Social Network Analysis
5. Week 5: Statistical Learning: Linear and Logistic Regression, Random Forest

This repo includes code for all homework assignments and for the case studies written in class, as well as the corresponding data. It additionally contains a submission for the final project, in which the student was tasked with predicting physical activity based on a dataset of x, y, and z accelerations and corresponding training set labels. 10-fold cross-validation and a parameter search using a random forest classifier was used for the final model. All assignments are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
